## Remote Unpaginated API

This scenario applies if:

* Loading your records from a remote API that is not pagination-enabled.
* You are ok with loading all records from the API in order to display one page at a time.
* Wish to display one page of records at a time.
* Want to have a page query parameter (optional).

This scenario is identical to the [Local Store](#local-store) scenario.
